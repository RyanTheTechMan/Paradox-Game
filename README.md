# Paradox Game

This team project was the final project for CS362 - Video Game Design.

The game consists of puzzles that require the player to move boxes on to buttons so that a door openes to the next level.

The game's gimmick is that you are able to switch between two time lines by looking through a Handheld Portal. When you are looking through the portal, you are able to interact with objects in the other dimension.

Lastly, there are multiple ways to activate the doors, such as buttons, timed buttons, levers, or a "paradox" variant of each.

When in paradox form, the activater will activate something in the other dimension.

Note that when something is moved in the present it will affect the future dimension.
